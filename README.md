# filmsDB
Short project to display films information from an API using ionic + angular

#How to use:
In order to use the app, you will need to create a 'environments' folder with this path:

'fimsDB/src/enviroments'
Which contains an 'environment.ts' file that exports an object with an API_KEY property.

The API_KEY shoud take a valid key for the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API.
